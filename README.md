For commit 1, Google firebase is used to allow the user to create and register for an account. A progress dialog is used to notify that their credentials for their account is being checked when registering for an account or logging into the app with an existing account. 

For commit 3, the coronavirus search has been implemented that includes asking the user to enter the name of a country into an edit text that will have the text gathered to perform a get request for coronavirus data for that country. The results are displayed into another activity where the user can click on "view chart" that will open up another activity. The chart activity will be implemented later.
